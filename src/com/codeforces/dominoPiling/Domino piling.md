<b>A. Domino piling</b><br/>

You are given a rectangular board of M × N squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2 × 1 squares. You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:<br/>

1. Each domino completely covers two squares.<br/>

2. No two dominoes overlap.<br/>

3. Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.<br/>

Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.<br/>

<b>Input</b><br/>
In a single line you are given two integers M and N — board sizes in squares (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 16).<br/>

<b>Output</b><br/>
Output one number — the maximal number of dominoes, which can be placed.<br/>
