There is some Mathematical logic behind this problem.

i) First ==> The number must be an even number. So we have to check if the number is even divided by 2 and the remainder is 0.

ii) Secondly ==> The number will not be equal to 2.

iii) Another way ==> We can check it by the opposite condition.
