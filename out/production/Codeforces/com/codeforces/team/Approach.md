For the Problem of <b>Team</b> ==><br/>
i) First we have to take input how many problems will be assigned<br/>
ii) When we will check the last problems by using of loops<br/>
iii)We will declare a global variable initialized the value with 0;<br/>
iv)In the Loop we will increase the value of result by taking 3 times input with only 1 and 0 value and add them<br/>
v) Then we will check if the addition is greater than 1 then it will return 1(true) or otherwise return false(0)<br/>
vi)Then we will print the result outside the loop
